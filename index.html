<h2>Midyear Project Design Document</h2>
<h3>By: Nam, Harrison, Nick and Alex</h3>
<h4><u>App Description</u></h4>
<h5>Purpose of App</h5>
<p>The purpose of the app is to create an easy to use attendance tracker.
Users will be able to add people to a roster, and from there, be able to record attendence.<br>
The innovation comes from the fact that each person in a roster will be assigned a unique qr code in which the application will generate.<br>
From there the app will generate pictures, which will be printed out on to paper. To take attendance, the student can show the instructor the qr code, and he/she will be scanned in. <br>
But there is more. The instructor will be able to ask the whole class to hold up there qr codes.<br> From there, the instructor can use the camera feature and sweep the room, recording everyones attendance. The application uses the actual clock. So instructors can set
time thresholds and absenses.
<h5>Target User Group</h5>
Teachers at the elementary, middle school and high school level.<br>
Extracurricular activity instructors.<br>
And anyone who needs a quick attendance tracker!
<h5>How can this app solve problems?</h5>
Many teachers have to take two to five minutes taking attendence at the start of class. They have to look around the room, ask students where their peers are... <br> Its a somewhat time consuming process.<br>
Our app attempts to speed up this process. While at Bronx Science teachers have to submit pink sheets and bubble in forms, this app can speed things up completely.<br>
The teacher just has to ask students to hold up their qr codes. This will take one to two minutes maximum. And the reports needed are automatically generated <br>
so the teacher can take care of submitting the forms at the end of the day.<br>
With the extra time, teachers can get back to doing what really matters, teaching!

<h4><u>User Interfaces</u></h4>

The user starts at this screen, ready to take attendance!<br>
<img src="UI-Layout/NewSessionResized.png" alt="New Session" style="width:216px;height:384px;">
<p>The user starts by adding a session and a roster.</p>
<img src="UI-Layout/TimeResized.png" alt="Time change" style="width:216px;height:384px;">
<p>The user will set what time are students present, late or absent.</p>
<img src="UI-Layout/SessionsResized.png" alt="A Session" style="width:216px;height:384px;">
<p>Once the session is created, here is what a session looks like.</p>  
<img src="UI-Layout/SessionsDropDownResized.png" alt="Sessions Drop Down" style="width:216px;height:384px;">
<p>Sessions can be switched via drop down menu.</p>
<img src="UI-Layout/CameraResized.png" alt="Camera" style="width:216px;height:384px;">
<p>When the user is ready to take attendence, they will use the camera.</p>
